# MappingExoplanets
MSci Project Code Repository (Python 2.7)

The main Jupyter Notebook .ipynb consists of the planet simulation and model.

The separate Python .py files contain the MCMC simulations:

- MCMC_algorithm is the main Monte-Carlo simulation.
- MCMC_plotting is the accompanying graph plotting for the MCMC.
- deltaT_errors is used to determine the errors on the combined eccentric+volcano plot.
- Ttot_Tfull_errors is used to plot and extract the errors on the total and fully occulted times.

The MCMC files have only been tested using 'Spyder'. The Jupyter Notebook generates several images and text files, so it is recommended to create a new directory when running this file.
